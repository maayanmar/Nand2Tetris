# Building a Computer from Nand
This README provides a brief overview of how I built the computer from the fundamental logic gates up to the CPU, which forms the brain of the computer.

## Overview
The computer is made up of three major components: CPU, memory & Screen. Each component serves a specific function and communicates with other components to perform various tasks.

## Nand
The Nand gate is the simplest and most fundamental logic gate in digital electronics. All other logic gates, such as And, Or, and Not gates, can be created using Nand gates.

## Logic
Once we have the basic logic gates, we can combine them to form more complex logic circuits such as adders, multiplexers, and shifters. Logic gates can be used to build bus systems that enable communication between different components, such as the ALU I built.

## ALU and Memory
The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) performs arithmetic and logical operations on data stored in memory. The memory stores data and instructions that the CPU needs to execute. Together, the ALU and memory enable the computer to perform operations and store results.

## CPU
The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the heart of the computer. It fetches instructions from memory and executes them. The CPU consists of three main components: the Control Unit (CU), the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), and Registers. The CU fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and directs the operation of the ALU and other components. The ALU performs arithmetic and logic operations, and registers store data.

## Computer
Once the CPU, memory, and other components are built, they are assembled to form a complete computer system. The computer can then be programmed to perform various tasks.
