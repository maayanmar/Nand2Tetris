# Simple HACK Computer Operating System
This project is a simple operating system built for the HACK computer architecture. It allows for basic operations such as communication through the screen and keyboard, computing mathematical operations, and saving data.

## Requirements
To use this operating system, you need a HACK computer hardware which we built in the previous project. 

## Screen Communication
The operating system provides a simple interface for communicating through the screen. It allows the user to display text and graphics on the screen.

## Keyboard Communication
The operating system provides an interface for receiving input through the keyboard. It allows the user to enter text and data into the system.

## Computing Mathematical Operations
The operating system provides basic mathematical functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These functions can be used to perform simple calculations and manipulate data.

## Saving Data
The operating system provides a simple way to store data. It allows the user to create objects in order to support object oriented programming.
