# Nand2Tetris Project
This repository contains my implementation for the Nand2Tetris project, which is a university course that teaches how to build a computer from scratch. The project covers both the hardware and software aspects of building a computer.

The project is divided into two parts: the first part covers building the hardware of the computer, and the second part covers building the software that runs on the computer.

## Hardware
The Hardware section of the project covers building the basic logic gates using the NAND gate and combining them to build more complex components such as adders, registers, and memory units. The final result of this section is a complete Hack computer with a CPU, memory, and input/output devices.

## Compiler
The Compiler section of the project covers building a compiler for a Java-like language. The compiler takes source code written in the high-level language and converts it into Hack assembly language, which can be executed on the Hack computer built in the Hardware section.

## OS
The OS section of the project covers building a simple operating system for the Hack computer. The operating system provides basic functionality such as screen and keyboard communication, mathematical calculations, and data storage.

Each section of the project has its own README file that provides more information on the implementation details and how to run the code.
